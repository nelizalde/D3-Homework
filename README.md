# D3-Homework

For this D3 Challenge, we're using a data set included with the assignment that is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. I decided to analyze data between the following two variables: Smokers and Age. My GitHub pages link will take you to the results, which I visualized on a Scatter Plot. Each point represents a different state and the corresponding rates for Smokers/Age.
